# Adapt Koat implementation to match the paper

- [ ] How does OCaml Compute SCCs? (â†’ can we remove the time check from the expected trivial sizebound method?)
- [ ] Add geometric distribution
- [ ] Adjust the elsb definition to match the updated one of the paper
- [ ] Ponder how we can substitute values in the new bounds
- [ ] Adapt the expected nontrivial sizebounds method
