\todo{Do}{Motivation for complexity analysis}

There exist complexity analysis tools that are able to find upper runtime bounds for arbitrary integer programs.
\todo{Often consider?}{Those tools only consider the absolute value of variables and only infer monotonic bounds.}
We present an extension which uses the actual values of variables.
Therefore it is necessary to extend the existing methods to be able to work with non-monotonic bounds.
As a result the extended method can now infer runtime bounds with better coefficients and better asymptotic complexity class.
