\section{Preliminaries}

In this chapter we introduce the definitions, that we need in this master's thesis.
In the first section, we define a set of terms which represent the bounds the analysis should be able to find. 
In the second section, we provide a formal definition of the programs inspected by the analysis.
The third section defines different types of complexities of the presented programs. 
The fourth section introduces the definition of ranking functions, which are used for the computation of time bounds.
In the fifth section a definition for the result variable graph of a program will be introduced.
This structure is useful for the computation of size bounds.
