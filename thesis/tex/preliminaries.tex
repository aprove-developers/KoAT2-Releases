\section{Preliminaries}

In this chapter we introduce the essential definitions, that we need in this master's thesis.
In the first section we provide a formal definition of integer transition systems.
The second section defines terms for the different types of complexity analysis. 
The third section introduces the definition of polynomial ranking functions, which are used for the computation of time bounds.
In the fourth section a definition for the result variable graph will be introduced.
