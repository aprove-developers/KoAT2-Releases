\section{Preliminaries}

This chapter introduces the definitions needed in this master's thesis.
The first section defines a set of terms which represents the bounds the analysis should be able to find. 
The second section provides a formal definition of the programs inspected by the analysis.
The third section defines a result variable graph.
This structure is useful for the computation of size bounds.
The fourth section introduces a definition of ranking functions.
These are used for the computation of time bounds and cost bounds.
