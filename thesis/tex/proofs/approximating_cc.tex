We have to show that $\eval{\text{cc}}{\valuation_0} \leq \eval{\sum_{t \in \TSet}\UCost(t)}{\valuation_0}$ holds for every state $\valuation_0 \in \Valuation$.

Lets assume there exists an infinite evaluation $(\location_0, \valuation_0) \rightarrow_{t_0} (\location_1, \valuation_1) \rightarrow_{t_1} \dots$ with $t_0, t_1, \dots \in \TSet$.
Since $c(t) \geq 1$ for all transitions $t \in \TSet$, the sum of the costs of this sequence of transitions $c(t_0) + c(t_1) + \dots$ is infinite and therefore the cost complexity $\eval{\text{cc}}{\valuation_0} = \infty$ is infinite.
Since the transition set $\TSet$ is finite, there must be a transition $t \in \TSet$, which occurs infinitely often in the evaluation.
Thus, $\eval{\UTime(t)}{\valuation_0} = \infty$ and therefore $\eval{\UCost(t)}{\valuation_0} = \infty$.
Then, we have $\eval{\sum_{t \in \TSet}\UCost(t)}{\valuation_0} = \infty$ and $\eval{\text{cc}}{\valuation_0} \leq \eval{\sum_{t \in \TSet}\UCost(t)}{\valuation_0}$.

Otherwise, every evaluation $(\location_0, \valuation_0) \rightarrow^k_T (\location, \valuation)$ is finite.
Since the time complexity $\text{rc}$ is defined as the maximal $k$ of all those evaluations, it suffices to prove that for any such evaluation $\eval{\sum_{t \in \TSet}\UTime(t)}{\valuation_0} \geq k$ holds.
Lets consider a fixed evaluation $(\location_0, \valuation_0) \rightarrow^k_T (\location, \valuation)$.
Let $k_t \in \mathbb{N}$ be the number of times a transition $t \in \TSet$ occurs in this evaluation.
Then, we have $k = \sum{t \in \TSet} k_t$.
Also, for each $t \in \TSet$ the evaluation must be of the form $(\location_0, \valuation_0) (\rightarrow^* \circ \rightarrow_t)^k (\location, \valuation)$.
Since by definition of $\UTime$ it holds that $\eval{\UTime(t)}{\valuation_0} \geq k_t$, we have $\eval{\sum_{t \in \TSet}\UTime(t)}{\valuation_0} \geq \sum_{t \in \TSet} k_t = k$.
