We have to show that $\text{cc}(\lstate, \ustate) \leq \appreval{\sum_{t \in \TSet}\UCost(t)}{\lstate}{\ustate}$ holds for every state $\valuation_0 \in \Valuation$.

Lets assume there exists a state $\valuation_0 \in \Valuation$ with $\valuation^\sqcup \leq \valuation_0 \leq \valuation^\sqcup$ such that there exists an infinite evaluation $(\location_0, \valuation_0) \rightarrow_{t_0} (\location_1, \valuation_1) \rightarrow_{t_1} \dots$.
Since $c(t) \geq 1$ for all transitions $t \in \TSet$, the sum of the costs of this sequence of transitions $c(t_0) + c(t_1) + \dots$ is infinite and therefore the cost complexity $\text{cc}(\lstate, \ustate) = \infty$ is infinite.
Since the transition set $\TSet$ is finite, there must be a transition $t \in \TSet$, which occurs infinitely often in the evaluation.
Thus, $\appreval{\UTime(t)}{\lstate}{\ustate} = \infty$ and therefore $\appreval{\UCost(t)}{\lstate}{\ustate} = \infty$.
Then, we have $\appreval{\sum_{t \in \TSet}\UCost(t)}{\lstate}{\ustate} = \infty$ and $\text{cc}(\lstate, \ustate) \leq \appreval{\sum_{t \in \TSet}\UCost(t)}{\lstate}{\ustate}$.

Otherwise, for every state $\valuation_0 \in \Valuation$ with $\valuation^\sqcup \leq \valuation_0 \leq \valuation^\sqcup$ every evaluation $(\location_0, \valuation_0) \rightarrow^k_T (\location, \valuation)$ is finite.
Lets fix such a state $\valuation_0$.
Since the time complexity $\text{rc}$ is defined as the maximal $k$ of all those evaluations, it suffices to prove that for any such evaluation $\appreval{\sum_{t \in \TSet}\UTime(t)}{\valuation^\sqcup}{\valuation^\sqcap} \geq k$ holds.
Lets consider a fixed evaluation $(\location_0, \valuation_0) \rightarrow^k_T (\location, \valuation)$.
Let $k_t \in \mathbb{N}$ be the number of times a transition $t \in \TSet$ occurs in this evaluation.
Then, we have $k = \sum_{t \in \TSet} k_t$.
Also, for each $t \in \TSet$ the evaluation must be of the form $(\location_0, \valuation_0) (\rightarrow^* \circ \rightarrow_t)^{k_t} (\location, \valuation)$.
Since by definition of $\UTime$ it holds that $\appreval{\UTime(t)}{\lstate}{\ustate} \geq k_t$, we have $\appreval{\sum_{t \in \TSet}\UTime(t)}{\lstate}{\ustate} \geq \sum_{t \in \TSet} k_t = k$.
