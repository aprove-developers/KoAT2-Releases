We have to show that $\text{cc}(\lstate, \ustate) \leq \sum_{t \in \TSet} \ueval{\UCost(t)}{\lstate}{\ustate}$ holds for every state $\valuation_0 \in \Valuation$.

Lets assume there exists a state $\valuation_0 \in \Valuation$ with $\lstate \leq \valuation_0 \leq \ustate$ such that there exists an infinite evaluation $(\location_0, \valuation_0) \rightarrow_{t_0} (\location_1, \valuation_1) \rightarrow_{t_1} \dots$.
Since $c(t) \geq 1$ for all transitions $t \in \TSet$, the sum of the costs of this sequence of transitions $c(t_0) + c(t_1) + \dots$ is infinite and therefore the cost complexity $\text{cc}(\lstate, \ustate) = \infty$ is infinite.
Since the transition set $\TSet$ is finite, there must be a transition $t \in \TSet$, which occurs infinitely often in the evaluation.
Thus, $\exacteval{\UCost(t)}{\valuation_0} = \infty$ and since $\exacteval{\UCost(t)}{\valuation_0} \leq \ueval{\UCost(t)}{\lstate}{\ustate}$, we also have $\ueval{\UCost(t)}{\lstate}{\ustate} = \infty$.
Then, we have $\sum_{t \in \TSet} \ueval{\UCost(t)}{\lstate}{\ustate} = \infty$ and $\text{cc}(\lstate, \ustate) \leq \sum_{t \in \TSet} \ueval{\UCost(t)}{\lstate}{\ustate}$.

Otherwise, for every state $\valuation_0 \in \Valuation$ with $\lstate \leq \valuation_0 \leq \ustate$ every evaluation $(\location_0, \valuation_0) \rightarrow_{t_0} (\location_1, \valuation_1) \rightarrow_{t_1} \dots \rightarrow_{t_k} (\location_k, \valuation_k)$ is finite.
Lets fix such a state $\valuation_0$.
Since the cost complexity $\text{cc}$ is defined as the maximal cost $\sum_{1 \leq i \leq k} \exacteval{\cost(t_i)}{\valuation_i}$ of all those evaluations and it also holds that $\exacteval{\UCost(t)}{\valuation_0} \leq \ueval{\UCost(t)}{\lstate}{\ustate}$, it suffices to prove that for any such evaluation \[ \exacteval{\UCost(t)}{\valuation_0} \geq \sum_{1 \leq i \leq k} \exacteval{\cost(t_i)}{\valuation_i} \] holds.
Lets consider a fixed evaluation.
\[ (\location_0, \valuation_0) \rightarrow_{t_0} (\location_1, \valuation_1) \rightarrow_{t_1} \dots \rightarrow_{t_k} (\location_k, \valuation_k) \]
Let $k_t \in \mathbb{N}$ be the number of times a transition $t \in \TSet$ occurs in the evaluation.
Then, for each $t \in \TSet$ the evaluation must be of the form
\[ (\location_0, \valuation_0) \rightarrow^* (\location^t_1, \valuation^t_1) (\rightarrow_t \circ \rightarrow^*)^{k_t-1} (\location^t_{k_t}, \valuation^t_{k_t}) \rightarrow_t \circ \rightarrow^* (\location_k, \valuation_k). \]
Then, we have \[ \sum_{1 \leq i \leq k} \exacteval{\cost(t_i)}{\valuation_i} = \sum_{t \in \TSet} \sum_{1 \leq i \leq k_t} \exacteval{\cost(t)}{\valuation^t_i}. \]
Since by definition of $\UCost$ it holds that $\exacteval{\UCost(t)}{\valuation_0} \geq \sum_{1 \leq i \leq k_t} \exacteval{\cost(t)}{\valuation^t_i}$, we have \[ \sum_{t \in \TSet} \exacteval{\UCost(t)}{\valuation_0} \geq \sum_{t \in \TSet} \sum_{1 \leq i \leq k_t} \exacteval{\cost(t)}{\valuation^t_i} = \sum_{1 \leq i \leq k} \exacteval{\cost(t_i)}{\valuation_i}. \]
