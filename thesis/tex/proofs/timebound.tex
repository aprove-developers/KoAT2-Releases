We want to prove the following claim for all \todo{Exclude t0}{$t \in \TSet$} and all $m \in \mathbb{N}^n$.
\[ \UTime'(t)(m) \geq \sup \braced{ k \mid \exists k \in \mathbb{N}, \valuation_0, \valuation: \abs{\valuation_0} \leq m \wedge \valuation_0 (\rightarrow_{t_0} \circ (\rightarrow^* \circ \rightarrow_t)^k) \valuation } \]

For $m \in \mathbb{N}^n$, let $\USize_m(t)$ be an assignment from each variable $v \in \VSet$ to the approximated value $\USize(t, v)(m)$.
It suffices to show that for all $t \in \TSet'_>$ and $m \in \mathbb{N}^n$ the following claim holds.
\begin{IEEEeqnarray*}{rCl}
  \sum_{\location \in \mathcal{E}_{\TSet'}} \sum_{\tilde{t} \in \TSet_l} \UTime(\tilde{t})(m) \cdot \maximum{0, ((\Pol(\location)_+)(\USize_m(\tilde{t})) - (\Pol(\location)_-)(\LSize_m(\tilde{t}))} \\
  \geq \sup \braced{ k \mid \exists k \in \mathbb{N}, \valuation_0, \valuation: \abs{\valuation_0} \leq m \wedge \valuation_0 (\rightarrow_{t_0} \circ (\rightarrow^* \circ \rightarrow_t)^k) \valuation }
\end{IEEEeqnarray*}
To this end, let $\valuation_0$ be a state with $\abs{\valuation_0} \leq m$ and consider a (finite or infinite) evaluation starting with $\valuation_0$ where $k \in \mathbb{N} \cup \braced{\omega}$ steps are performed with the transition $t$.
The goal is now to show that
\begin{IEEEeqnarray*}{rCl}
  \sum_{\location \in \mathcal{E}_{\TSet'}} \sum_{\tilde{t} \in \TSet_l} \UTime(\tilde{t})(m) \cdot \maximum{0, ((\Pol(\location)_+)(\USize_m(\tilde{t})) - ((\Pol(\location)_-)(\LSize_m(\tilde{t}))} \geq k
\end{IEEEeqnarray*}

\todo{Is it?}{This is trivial for $k = 0$.}
We now consider the case where $k > 0$.

Let $\rightarrow^+_\TSet$ denote the transitive closure of $\rightarrow_\TSet$.
Then, we can use the following representation for the considered evaluation.
\begin{IEEEeqnarray*}{lClC}
  \valuation_0 & \rightarrow^+_{\TSet \setminus \TSet'} & \hat{\valuation}_1 & \rightarrow^+_{\TSet'} \\
  \valuation_1 & \rightarrow^+_{\TSet \setminus \TSet'} & \hat{\valuation}_2 & \rightarrow^+_{\TSet'} \\
  \valuation_2 & \rightarrow^+_{\TSet \setminus \TSet'} & \dots
\end{IEEEeqnarray*}
In this evaluation, the outgoing edges of all $\hat{\valuation}_i$ are labeled by transitions from $\TSet'$.
The outgoing edges of all $\valuation_i$ are labeled by transitions from $\TSet \setminus \TSet'$.

Now we have to investigate how often the transition $t$ is used in the evaluation.
Since $t \in \TSet'$, it can only be used in sequences of the following form.
\[ \hat{\valuation}_i \rightarrow^+_{\TSet'} \valuation_i \]
\todo{And we probably should}{We can show that the following term is an upper bound on the number of times the transition $t$ is used in this sequence.}
\[ \maximum{0, (\Pol(\location)_+)(\hat{\valuation}_i) - (\Pol(\location)_-)(\hat{\valuation}_i)} \]

Let the transition in the evaluation reaching $\hat{\valuation}_i$ be labeled by $\tilde{t}_i = (\tilde{\location}_i, \tilde{\tau}, \hat{\location}_i)$.
Thus, we have $\hat{\location}_i \in \mathcal{E}_{\TSet'}$ and $\tilde{t}_i \in \TSet_{\hat{\location}_i}$.
As \todo{Check, if that hasn't changed}{$\valuation_0 \rightarrow^*_\TSet \circ \rightarrow_{\tilde{t}_i} \hat{\valuation}_i$} and $\abs{\valuation_0} \leq m$, by definition of the size approximations we have $\USize(\tilde{t}_i, v')(m) \geq \hat{\valuation}_i(v) \geq \LSize(\tilde{t}_i, v')(m)$.
By the weak monotonicity of $\Pol(\hat{\location}_i)_+$ and $\Pol(\hat{\location}_i)_-$ we can conclude the following two statements.
\begin{IEEEeqnarray*}{lCl}
  \Pol(\hat{\location}_i)_+(\USize_m(\tilde{t}_i)) \geq \Pol(\hat{\location}_i)_+(\hat{\valuation}_i) \\
  \Pol(\hat{\location}_i)_-(\LSize_m(\tilde{t}_i)) \leq \Pol(\hat{\location}_i)_-(\hat{\valuation}_i)
\end{IEEEeqnarray*}
Thus, we can conclude an upper bound on the number of times the transition $t$ is used in the sequence.
\[ \maximum{0, (\Pol(\location)_+)(\USize_m(\tilde{t})) - ((\Pol(\location)_-)(\LSize_m(\tilde{t})} \]

It remains to examine how often such a sequence can occur in the full evaluation.
As observed earlier, the transition reaching $\hat{\valuation}_i$ in the evaluation is always labeled by some $\tilde{t}_i = (\tilde{\location}_i, \tilde{\tau}, \hat{\location}_i) \in \TSet_{\hat{\location}_i}$.
Each $\tilde{t}_i$ can occur at most $\UTime(\tilde{t}_i)(m)$ times in evaluations.
As discussed previously, in every $\TSet'$-sequence the transition $t$ can be applied at most $(\Pol(\location)_+)(\hat{\valuation}_i) - (\Pol(\location)_-)(\hat{\valuation}_i)$ times.
Thus, we can infer that our initial statement holds.
\begin{IEEEeqnarray*}{rCl}
  \sum_{\location \in \mathcal{E}_{\TSet'}} \sum_{\tilde{t} \in \TSet_l} \UTime(\tilde{t})(m) \cdot \maximum{0, (\Pol(\location)_+)(\USize_m(\tilde{t})) - ((\Pol(\location)_-)(\LSize_m(\tilde{t})} \geq k
\end{IEEEeqnarray*}
