We have to show that $\text{rc}(\lstate, \ustate) \leq \sum_{t \in \TSet} \ueval{\UTime(t)}{\lstate}{\ustate}$ holds for states $\lstate, \ustate \in \Valuation$ with $\lstate \leq \ustate$.

Lets assume there exists a state $\valuation_0 \in \Valuation$ with $\lstate \leq \valuation_0 \leq \ustate$ such that there exists an infinite evaluation $(\location_0, \valuation_0) \rightarrow_T (\location_1, \valuation_1) \rightarrow_T \dots$.
Then, the time complexity $\text{rc}(\lstate, \ustate) = \infty$ is infinite.
Also, there must be a transition $t \in \TSet$, which occurs infinitely often in the evaluation.
Thus, $\ueval{\UTime(t)}{\lstate}{\ustate} = \infty$ and therefore we have $\sum_{t \in \TSet} \ueval{\UTime(t)}{\lstate}{\ustate} = \infty$ and $\text{rc}(\lstate, \ustate) \leq \sum_{t \in \TSet} \ueval{\UTime(t)}{\lstate}{\ustate}$.

Otherwise, for every state $\valuation_0 \in \Valuation$ with $\lstate \leq \valuation_0 \leq \ustate$ every evaluation $(\location_0, \valuation_0) \rightarrow^k_T (\location, \valuation)$ is finite.
Lets fix such a state $\valuation_0$.
Since the time complexity $\text{rc}$ is defined as the maximal $k$ of all those evaluations and it also holds that $\exacteval{\UTime(t)}{\valuation_0} \leq \ueval{\UTime(t)}{\lstate}{\ustate}$, it suffices to prove that for any such evaluation $\sum_{t \in \TSet} \exacteval{\UTime(t)}{\valuation_0} \geq k$ holds.
Lets consider a fixed evaluation $(\location_0, \valuation_0) \rightarrow^k_T (\location, \valuation)$.
Let $k_t \in \mathbb{N}$ be the number of times a transition $t \in \TSet$ occurs in this evaluation.
Then, we have $k = \sum_{t \in \TSet} k_t$.
Also, for each $t \in \TSet$ the evaluation must be of the form $(\location_0, \valuation_0) (\rightarrow^* \circ \rightarrow_t)^{k_t} (\location_t, \valuation_t) \rightarrow^* (\location, \valuation)$.
Since by definition of $\UTime$ it holds that $\exacteval{\UTime(t)}{\valuation_0} \geq k_t$, we have $\sum_{t \in \TSet} \exacteval{\UTime(t)}{\valuation_0} \geq \sum_{t \in \TSet} k_t = k$.
