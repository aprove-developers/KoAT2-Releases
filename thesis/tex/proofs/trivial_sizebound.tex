Let $\alpha = (t, v) \in \RV$ be the trivial SCC for which the processor was applied.

We have to show that for all $m \in \mathbb{N}^n$ two statements hold.
\[ \USize'(t, v)(m) \geq \UpperSizeComplexity{t}{v} \]
\[ \LSize'(t, v)(m) \leq \LowerSizeComplexity{t}{v} \]

To this end, we consider a valuation $\abs{\valuation_0} \leq m$ and an evaluation
\[ \configuration{0} \valuateto{t} \configuration{} . \]
Now the goal is to show that $\USize'(t, v)(m) \geq \valuation(v) \geq \LSize'(t, v)(m)$ holds.

If $t$ is an initial transition, then the evaluation has the form $\configuration{0} \rightarrow_t \configuration{}$, as by definition there are no transitions leading back to the initial location $\location_0$.

Thus, for initial transitions by the definition of sizebounds we obtain
\[ \USize'(t, v)(m) = \ULSB(t, v)(m) \geq \valuation(v). \]
\[ \LSize'(t, v)(m) = \LLSB(t, v)(m) \leq \valuation(v). \]

In the case where t is not an initial transition, the evaluation has for some transition $\tilde{t} \in \pre(t)$ the form
\[ \configuration{0}  \valuateto{\tilde{t}} (\tilde{\location}, \tilde{\valuation}) \rightarrow_t \configuration{}. \]

Lets assume that our initial assumption holds.
As $\abs{\valuation_0} \leq m$, we then have for all $v \in \VSet$
\[ \USize(\tilde{t}, v)(m) \geq \tilde{\valuation}(v) \geq \LSize(\tilde{t}, v)(m). \]
Thus, $\USize(\tilde{t}, v)$ and $\LSize(\tilde{t}, v)$ are bounds for the size of all variables $v \in \VSet$ before the transition $t$ is applied.

The only interesting case is when $\alpha$ is bounded by a lower scaled sum and by an upper scaled sum.

We can easily see that the following unequations hold.
\[ \sum_{v \in P_{\alpha,1}^\sqcap} \USize(\tilde{t}, v) \geq \sum_{v \in P_{\alpha,1}^\sqcap} \tilde{\valuation}(v) \]
\[ - \sum_{v \in N_{\alpha,1}^\sqcap} \LSize(\tilde{t}, v) \geq - \sum_{v \in N_{\alpha,1}^\sqcap} \tilde{\valuation}(v) \]
\[ \sum_{v \in P_{\alpha,2}^\sqcap} \max \braced{0,\USize(\tilde{t}, v)} \geq \sum_{v \in P_{\alpha,2}^\sqcap} \max \braced{0,\tilde{\valuation}(v)} \]
\[ \sum_{v \in N_{\alpha,2}^\sqcap} \max \braced{0,-\LSize(\tilde{t}, v)} \geq \sum_{v \in N_{\alpha,2}^\sqcap} \max \braced{0,-\tilde{\valuation}(v)} \]
Since $s^\sqcap_\alpha \geq 1$ it holds that $\USize(t, v)(m) \geq \valuation(v)$.

We now show that $\LSize(t, v)(m) \leq \valuation(v)$ also holds.
Again we can easily see that the following unequations hold.
\[ \sum_{v \in P_{\alpha,1}^\sqcup} \LSize(\tilde{t}, v) \leq \sum_{v \in P_{\alpha,1}^\sqcup} \tilde{\valuation}(v) \]
\[ - \sum_{v \in N_{\alpha,1}^\sqcup} \USize(\tilde{t}, v) \leq - \sum_{v \in N_{\alpha,1}^\sqcup} \tilde{\valuation}(v) \]
\[ - \sum_{v \in P_{\alpha,2}^\sqcup} \max \braced{0,-\LSize(\tilde{t}, v)} \leq - \sum_{v \in P_{\alpha,2}^\sqcup} \max \braced{0,-\tilde{\valuation}(v)} \]
\[ - \sum_{v \in N_{\alpha,2}^\sqcup} \max \braced{0,\USize(\tilde{t}, v)} \leq - \sum_{v \in N_{\alpha,2}^\sqcup} \max \braced{0,\tilde{\valuation}(v)} \]
Since $s^\sqcup_\alpha \geq 1$ it holds that $\LSize(t, v)(m) \leq \valuation(v)$.
