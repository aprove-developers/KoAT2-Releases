Let $\alpha = (t, v') \in \RV$ be the trivial SCC for which the processor was applied.
We have to show that for all $m \in \mathbb{N}^n$ two statements hold.
\[ \USize'(t, v')(m) \geq \UpperSizeComplexity{t}{v} \]
\[ \LSize'(t, v')(m) \leq \LowerSizeComplexity{t}{v} \]

To this end, we consider a valuation $\valuation_0 \leq m$ and an evaluation
\[ \configuration{0} \valuateto{t} \configuration{} . \]
Now the goal is to show that $\USize'(t, v')(m) \geq \valuation(v) \geq \LSize'(t, v')(m)$ holds.

If $t$ is an initial transition, then the evaluation has the form $\configuration{0} \rightarrow_t \configuration{}$, as by definition there are no transitions leading back to the initial location $\location_0$.

Thus, for initial transitions by the definition of sizebounds we obtain
\[ \USize'(t, v')(m) = \ULSB(t, v')(m) \geq \valuation(v). \]
\[ \LSize'(t, v')(m) = \LLSB(t, v')(m) \leq \valuation(v). \]

In the case where t is not an initial transition, the evaluation has for some transition $\tilde{t} \in \pre(t)$ the form
\[ \configuration{0}  \valuateto{\tilde{t}} (\tilde{\location}, \tilde{\valuation}) \rightarrow_t \configuration{}. \]

Lets assume that our initial assumption holds.
As $\valuation_0 \leq m$, we then have for all $v \in \VSet$
\[ \USize(\tilde{t}, v')(m) \geq \tilde{\valuation}(v) \geq \LSize(\tilde{t}, v')(m). \]
Thus, $\USize(\tilde{t}, v')$ and $\LSize(\tilde{t}, v')$ are bounds for the size of all variables $v \in \VSet$ before the transition $t$ is applied.

By the weak monotonicity of $p_+$ and $p_-$ for every polynomial $p$ we can conclude the following statement.
\[ ((\ULSB(t, v')_+)(\USize(\tilde{t})) - (\ULSB(t, v')_-)(\LSize(\tilde{t})))(m) \geq \valuation(v) \]

Hence, $\USize'(t, v')(m) \geq \valuation(v)$.
