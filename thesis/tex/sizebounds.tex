\section{Computing size bounds}

The last chapter presented an algorithm to infer time bounds based on already inferred size bounds.
In this chapter we present a method, which is able to infer such size bounds for the values of the variables at particular transitions of a program.
In the first section, an algorithm for the computation of local size bounds is presented.
The method of the second section uses these local size bounds to infer global size bounds for trivial SCCs.
Then, the third section defines a method for the computation of size bounds of non-trivial SCCs, which is based on the so far computed size bounds and time bounds.
