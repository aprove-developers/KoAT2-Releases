\chapter{Computing Size Bounds}

The last chapter presented an algorithm to infer non-monotonic time bounds based on lower and upper size bounds.
This chapter presents a method, which is able to infer such size bounds.
The first section presents a concrete definition of local size bounds.
The method of the second section uses these local size bounds to infer global size bounds for trivial SCCs.
Then, the third section defines a method for the computation of size bounds of non-trivial SCCs.
This method is based on the so far computed size bounds and time bounds.
