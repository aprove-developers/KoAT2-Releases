\subsection{Programs}

This section defines the term of a program.
In this master's thesis, we consider programs with the following properties.

\begin{itemize}
\item Sequential: All operations get executed one after the other
\item Non-recursive: Recursive function calls are not allowed
\item Mathematical integers: The variables have values from the mathematical integer domain $\mathbb{Z}$
\item Non-determinism: From a state we can enter non-deterministically multiple other states
\item No heap usage
\item Under- and overapproximation: Programs are allowed to be non-exact
\end{itemize}

\begin{definition}[Program] 
  Let $\VSet$ be the set of all occurring program variables.
  A state is a total function $\valuation: \VSet \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_\bot$ which assigns each program variable $v \in \VSet$ a value $\valuation(v) \in \mathbb{Z}_\bot = \mathbb{Z} \cup \braced{\bot}$.
  We denote with $\valuation(v) = \bot$ that the state does not define a value for the variable $v$.
  We write $\Valuation = \braced{ \valuation \mid \valuation: \VSet \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_\bot}$ to denote the set of all states.
  Let $\LSet$ be the set of all locations of a program.
  Let $\TSet = \LSet \times ((\VSet \rightarrow \BoundSet_p) \times (\VSet \rightarrow \BoundSet_p)) \times 2^\AtomSet \times \LSet$ be the set of all transitions of the program.
  A transition $t = (\location, (\lupdate, \uupdate), \guard, \location')$ consists of the start location $\location$, the target location $\location'$, the lower and upper update functions $\update^\sqcup$ and $\update^\sqcap$ and the guard $\guard$. 
  A program graph is a tuple $(\LSet, \TSet)$ where $\LSet$ is the set of program locations and $\TSet$ is a subset of all possible transitions between them.
  Let $\cost: \TSet \rightarrow \BoundSet$ be a function which maps each transition to its costs with a specific state.
  A program is a tuple $\Program = ((\LSet, \TSet), \location_0, \VSet, c)$.
  We denote with $\location_0$ the unique program location with $\location_0 \in \LSet$ which has no entry transitions in the program.
  We write $t_0$ for an initial transition. That is a transition $(\location_0, \tau, \location) \in \TSet$ where the start location is the initial location $\location_0$.
  We write $\TSet_0 \subseteq \TSet$ to denote the set of all initial transitions.
\end{definition}
The definition is based on the definition of programs of the previous KoAT \cite{koat} and a definition which distinguishes between guards and updates \cite{lowerruntime}.

Futhermore, we use a common definition of strongly connected components of a program $\Program$ \cite{sccs}.

\begin{definition}[Strongly connected component]
  Let $\Program = ((\LSet, \TSet), \location_0, \VSet, c)$ be a program.
  We define $\SCC \subseteq \LSet$ as strongly connected component iff it is maximal and from every location $\location \in \SCC$ every other location $\location' \in \SCC$ is reachable.
\end{definition}

Informally, we can describe a strongly connected component as a maximal loop in a program.
From this point on, we also use the abbreviation SCC for a strongly connected component.

In an integer transition system, every variable is considered to be an integer value.
A transition defines a possible move from one location to another location, if certain conditions are met.
In a transition $(\location,\update,\guard,\location') \in \TSet$, the guard $\guard$ represents the condition, which has to be fulfiled to move to the location $\location'$.
The pair of update functions $\update = (\lupdate, \uupdate)$ assigns each variable an underapproximated value and an overapproximated value after the transition step.
We write $\update(v) = b$ for any variable $v \in \VSet$ and any bound $b \in \BoundSet$ iff we have an exact approximation $\uupdate(v) = \lupdate(v) = b$.
\todo{Explain}{}

We consider non-deterministic programs in this master's thesis.
Therefore there is no restriction, that from a location $\location \in \LSet$ there must be only one possible transition, for which the condition is fulfiled.
For example $\Program = (\braced{\location_0,\location_1,\location_2},\braced{(\location_0,\text{id},\text{true},\location_1),(\location_0,\text{id},\text{true},\location_2)})$ is a valid program, although it is possible to both move to $\location_1$ and $\location_2$ from location $\location_0$.
Such a program is not representable in common software languages.

For the definition of a run in a program, we define the terms of states and configurations.

\begin{definition}[Configuration] 
  A configuration is a pair $(\location, \valuation) \in \LSet \times \Valuation$ that defines the values of the program variables at a specific location.
\end{definition}

For two states $\valuation_1, \valuation_2 \in \Valuation$ we define $\valuation_1 \leq \valuation_2$ iff for all variables $v \in \VSet$ it holds that $\valuation_1(v) \leq \valuation_2(v)$.
We also define for a state $\valuation \in \Valuation$ the absolute value $\abs{\valuation} \in \Valuation$ iff for all variables $v \in \VSet$ it holds that $\abs{\valuation}(v) = \abs{\valuation(v)}$.

In a last step, we have to define, how a program can be executed.
Therefore we define the term of an evaluation.

\begin{definition}[Evaluation] 
  For a transition $t \in \TSet$ an evaluation step $\rightarrow_t \in (\LSet \times \Sigma) \times (\LSet \times \Sigma)$ is a relation between a previous state at a location and a resulting state at a following location.
  We write $(\location, \valuation) \rightarrow_t (\location', \valuation')$ iff with $t = (\location_t, (\lupdate, \uupdate), \guard, \location_t') \in \TSet$ it holds that the state satisfies the guard $\valuation \models \guard$ and the resulting state is bounded by the updated state $ \eval{\lupdate(v)}{\valuation} \leq \eval{v}{\valuation'} \leq \eval{\uupdate(v)}{\valuation}$ for each variable $v \in \VSet$ as well as $\location = \location_t$ and $\location' = \location_t'$.
  We omit the transition and write $(\location, \valuation) \rightarrow (\location', \valuation')$ iff there exists a transition $t \in \TSet$ such that $(\location, \valuation) \rightarrow_t (\location', \valuation')$ holds.
  We write $(\location, \valuation) \rightarrow^k (\location', \valuation')$ iff there exists a sequence of transitions $t_1, \dots, t_k \in \TSet$ such that $(\location, \valuation) \rightarrow_{t_1} \dots \rightarrow_{t_k} (\location', \valuation')$ holds.
  We write $(\location, \valuation) \rightarrow^* (\location', \valuation')$ iff there exists a $k \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $(\location, \valuation) \rightarrow^k (\location', \valuation')$ holds.
  We write $(\location, \valuation) \rightarrow_{\TSet'} (\location', \valuation')$ iff there exists a transition $t \in \TSet' \subseteq \TSet$ such that $(\location, \valuation) \rightarrow_t (\location', \valuation')$ holds.
\end{definition}
