\begin{theorem}[SizeBounds for trivial SCCs]
  Let $(\UTime, \Size)$ be a complexity approximation.
  Let $\braced{(t,v)} \subseteq \RV$ be a trivial SCC of the RVG.
  Let $\LSB$ be a local size bound in the form of a scaled sum.
  We define $\USize'(\outrv) = \USize(\outrv)$ and $\LSize'(\outrv) = \LSize(\outrv)$ for all $\outrv \neq (t,v)$.
  If $t \in \TSet_0$ is an initial transition, we define
  \[ \LSize'(t, v) = \LLSB(t, v) \text{ and } \USize'(t, v) = \ULSB(t, v). \]
  If $t \in \TSet \setminus \TSet_0$ is not an initial transition, we define the following.
  We define $\LSize'(t,v) = \LSize(t,v)$, if $(t,v)$ is not bounded by a lower scaled sum.
  Similar, we define $\USize'(t,v) = \USize(t,v)$, if $(t,v)$ is not bounded by an upper scaled sum.
  For all $(t,v)$ which are bounded by an upper scaled sum and by a lower scaled sum, we define 
  \[ \USize'(t,v) = \maximum{ \subst{\ULSB(t,v)}{\LSize(\pret)}{\USize(\pret)} \mid \pret \in \pre(t)} \]
  \[ \LSize'(t,v) = \minimum{ \subst{\LLSB(t,v)}{\USize(\pret)}{\LSize(\pret)} \mid \pret \in \pre(t)} \]
  Then, $\mathit{SizeBounds}(\UTime, \Size, \braced{(t,v)}) = (\LSize', \USize')$ is also a size approximation.
