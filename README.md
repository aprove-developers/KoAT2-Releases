# KoAT2
Reimplementation of KoAT with control-flow refinement, multiphase ranking functions and twn-loops.

## Build

### Build directly from source code

1. Use `opam init` and follow the instructions to set up Opam and install OCaml 4.06.1 if necessary
2. `opam install -j$(nproc) . --deps-only`
      * requires the _gmp_ and _mpfr_â€‚libraries
3. Run `omake` to build KoAT2
4. You may add `export PATH=$PATH:"path-to-Koat2-repository/Koat2/src/main/"` (with the substituted path) into your .bashrc file to use `koat2` directly.
5. For Controlflow - Refinement download https://github.com/jesusjda/pyRankFinder/releases/download/v1.3.2/irankfinder_1.3.2_linux_x86_64.zip and unzip it. Add `export PATH=$PATH:"path-to-irankfinder-folder/irankfinder/"` (with the substituted path) into your .bashrc file such that KoAT2 is able to find iRankFinder.

### Build [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image

1. Install docker as described [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
2. Execute `./build_container.sh` in the topdirectory of this repository. This builds a docker image with the name `koat2`. The docker image contains a static binary.

## Static Binary

To get a statically linked binary, please execute the script `compile_static_binary.sh`. This will set up a docker container in which OCaml 4.09.1 for compiling static binaries using musl is installed with all required packages to compile KoAT2. Please note that in this case, the used libraries (see below) are linked _statically_ into the resulting binary. The code of these libraries can be found when following the given links below.

## Run

1. After compiling the testprogram "test" is run, it can be found in the subdirectory test.
2. Run ./koat2 in main to get the help page of koat2
  For further information run ./koat2 commandname --help
  The main command proceeding a full analysis is the "analyse" command.

## Used Libraries
KoAT2 makes use of the following external tools and libraries.

- [APRON](<https://antoinemine.github.io/Apron/doc/>)
- [Batteries](<http://ocaml-batteries-team.github.io/batteries-included/hdoc2/>)
- [Cmdliner](<http://erratique.ch/software/cmdliner/doc/Cmdliner>)
- [FPath](<https://erratique.ch/software/fpath>)
- [Ocamlgraph](<http://ocamlgraph.lri.fr/doc/>)
- [Ocamlnet](<http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/ocamlnet.html>) for HTML proof output
- [Parmap](<https://github.com/rdicosmo/parmap>)
- [ppx_deriving](<https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/ppx_deriving>)
- [ppx_deriving_cmdliner](<https://github.com/hammerlab/ppx_deriving_cmdliner>)
- [ppx_getenv](<https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/ppx_getenv>)
- [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3)

## External Tools
In its analysis, KoAT2 may use control-flow refinement via partial evaluation (see [here](https://aprove-developers.github.io/ComplexityMprfCfr/) for more details). To this end, it uses the external tool [iRankFinder](http://irankfinder.loopkiller.com:8081/). To use it, please install it on your system. However, [iRankFinder](http://irankfinder.loopkiller.com:8081/) is already included in the Docker image.

To generate an image of the graph of an integer program, KoAT2 invokes [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/), which has to be manually installed on the system. Note that when building the Docker image, the current Ubuntu binaries of [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) are installed. Thus, the resulting image already contains [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/).

Moreover, the Docker image also contains both [clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) and [llvm2kittel](https://github.com/s-falke/llvm2kittel) which are used to transform C programs into the input format of KoAT.

## Input Format

To analyze programs with KoAT2, they need to be represented as *Integer Transition Systems*.
We use an extended version of [KoAT's input format](http://aprove.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/eval/IntegerComplexity/), which is also used in the category *Complexity of Integer Transition Systems* at the annual *Termination and Complexity Competition*.

In this extension, rules can be annotated with polynomial costs:

```
l1(A,B) -{A^2,A^2+B}> l2(A,B) :|: B >= 0
```
Here, `A^2` and `A^2+B` are lower and upper bounds on the cost of the rule.
The lower bound is ignored by KoAT2.
The upper bound has to be non-negative for every model of the transition's guard.

At the moment, we do not support recursion, i.e., we only support `Com_1`, which can also be omitted.

## Run

1. After compiling the testprogram "test" is run, it can be found in the subdirectory test.
  *One* of the test *fails*, due to a wrong input format, which is a correct test for the given file.
2. Run ./koat2 in main to get the help page of koat2
  For further information run ./koat2 commandname --help
  The main command proceeding a full analysis is the "analyse" command.
