cfr1.koat:
 - If A > 0, we increase B until B > C and then decrease A. If now A < 0, we decrease C.
 - best: n
 - normal: n^2
 - cfr without timelimits: inf time ~5s

cfr2.koat:
 - default example: We first increase B until B > C  and decrease A by 1 afterwards until A < 0.
 - best: n
 - normal: n^2
 - cfr wt: inf time ~4s

cfr3.koat:
 - default example with C := 0 and decrease A by B
 - best: n
 - normal: n^2
 - cfr wt: n time ~8s

cfr4.koat:
 - two independent parallel SCCs with a bad transition as in cfr3.koat
 - best: n
 - normal: n^2
 - cfr wt: n time ~10s

cfr5.koat:
 - two parallel SCCs with a bad transition and which share a transition
 - best: n
 - normal: n^2
 - cfr wt: n time >10m

cfr6.koat: 
 - first example cfr5.koat and afterwards cfr.3 with fresh values
 - best: n
 - normal n^2
 - cfr wt: n time >10m
